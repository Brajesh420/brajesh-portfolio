  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Time Traveller is a 2D puzzle-platformer prototype centered around time manipulation mechanics and structured environmental interaction.
    The project focuses on introducing a unique gameplay mechanic while maintaining clarity and progressive learning.

  <h2>Core Gameplay Loop</h2>
  <p>
    Explore → Manipulate Time → Solve Environmental Puzzle → Progress
  </p>
  <p>
    Each level introduces new constraints or variations of the time mechanic, encouraging experimentation and strategic thinking.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
  <p>
    The time manipulation mechanic was introduced gradually to prevent player confusion.
    Visual cues and object state feedback were designed to clearly communicate time changes and their impact on the environment.
    Puzzle difficulty was scaled based on mechanic familiarity rather than complexity alone.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    • Implemented time-state tracking system  
    • Designed object behavior switching logic  
    • Built conditional triggers for puzzle mechanics  
    • Structured level progression for mechanic reinforcement  
    • Optimized player-state transitions for smooth interaction  
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
  <p>
    Ensuring clarity during time manipulation was the biggest challenge.
    Early versions caused confusion due to insufficient visual feedback.
    This was resolved by refining object state indicators and improving animation transitions.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    This project strengthened my understanding of mechanic introduction, player guidance, and puzzle-based progression design.
    It reinforced the importance of clarity when designing unconventional gameplay systems.
