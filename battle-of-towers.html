  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Battle Of Towers is a 2D tower defense strategy prototype built in Unity, focused on wave progression systems, resource balancing, and strategic player decision-making.
    The project explores structured difficulty scaling and tactical gameplay under increasing pressure.

  <h2>Core Gameplay Loop</h2>
  <p>
    Build Towers → Defend Against Waves → Earn Resources → Upgrade → Survive Next Wave
  </p>
  <p>
    The loop encourages strategic placement, upgrade timing, and adaptive decision-making based on enemy types and wave difficulty.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
  <p>
    Towers were balanced around cost-to-effectiveness ratio to prevent dominant strategies.
    Enemy waves were structured to introduce new challenges gradually, encouraging player adaptation rather than overwhelming difficulty spikes.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    • Implemented dynamic wave management system  
    • Designed enemy path-following logic  
    • Built tower targeting and attack systems  
    • Structured resource economy framework  
    • Developed scalable upgrade architecture  
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
  <p>
    Balancing enemy progression required multiple iteration cycles.
    Early versions caused sudden difficulty spikes.
    Adjustments to spawn intervals, health scaling, and reward values created a smoother progression curve.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    This project strengthened my understanding of system balancing, player progression design, and scalable gameplay architecture in strategy-based mechanics.
