  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Raana is a 3D action gameplay prototype developed in Unity, focused on building responsive combat mechanics and modular enemy AI systems.  
    The project explores structured encounter design, player feedback clarity, and balanced progression within a controlled combat environment.

  <h2>Core Gameplay Loop</h2>
  <p>
    Explore → Engage Enemies → Combat → Clear Encounter → Progress
  </p>
  <p>
    The gameplay loop emphasizes timing, positioning, and decision-making during combat. Each encounter is designed to gradually increase difficulty while reinforcing learned mechanics.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
  <p>
    Combat was designed to prioritize responsiveness and clarity over unnecessary complexity.  
    Enemy behavior patterns were structured to introduce pressure progressively rather than overwhelm the player instantly.  
    Visual and timing feedback were carefully tuned to ensure that player actions feel impactful and readable.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    • Implemented a modular player controller system in Unity  
    • Built state-based enemy AI (Idle, Patrol, Chase, Attack, Death states)  
    • Designed hit detection and damage handling architecture  
    • Structured combat interactions for scalability and future feature expansion  
    • Synced animation timing with gameplay logic for accurate feedback  
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
  <p>
    One major challenge was balancing animation timing with gameplay responsiveness.  
    Early iterations caused slight delays between input and combat feedback.  
    This was resolved by refining animation transitions and restructuring hit detection logic to reduce perceived latency.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    This project strengthened my understanding of gameplay architecture, AI state management, and combat system balancing.  
    It reinforced the importance of iterative tuning and player feedback in building satisfying action mechanics.
