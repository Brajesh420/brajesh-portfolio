  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Board Game is a structured turn-based physical strategy game focused on rule clarity,
    balanced player interaction, and decision-driven progression.
    The project explores system design beyond digital implementation,
    emphasizing fairness and strategic depth.

  <h2>Core Gameplay Loop</h2>
  <p>
    Roll → Move → Trigger Event → Resolve Outcome → Switch Turn
  </p>
  <p>
    The gameplay loop encourages planning, probability assessment,
    and tactical decision-making within a structured rule framework.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
  <p>
    Rules were intentionally structured to prevent ambiguity and dominant strategies.
    Player advantages and progression mechanics were balanced through multiple playtesting iterations.
    The design emphasizes fairness, clarity, and strategic depth.
  </p>

  <h2>System Structure</h2>
  <p>
    • Defined turn-based state transitions  
    • Designed event-trigger framework  
    • Balanced reward and penalty mechanics  
    • Structured win-condition logic  
    • Iteratively refined rules through testing  
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
  <p>
    Early versions revealed balance issues where certain strategies dominated gameplay.
    Adjustments to rule constraints and event probabilities created a more competitive and fair experience.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    This project strengthened my understanding of system-based design,
    balance iteration, and rule clarity in structured gameplay experiences.
