  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Stack The Blocks is a 2D physics-based mobile arcade game focused on precision timing and progressive difficulty scaling.
    The project explores clean mechanic design, short-session engagement, and consistent physics behavior for mobile platforms.

  <h2>Core Gameplay Loop</h2>
  <p>
    Tap → Drop Block → Stack Precisely → Score → Increase Speed → Repeat
  </p>
  <p>
    The gameplay loop is designed for quick mobile sessions, with difficulty increasing gradually to maintain engagement without overwhelming the player.
  </p>

  <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
  <p>
    Physics behavior was intentionally tuned to remain predictable rather than random.
    Difficulty scaling was implemented through movement speed adjustments instead of sudden mechanic changes.
    The design emphasizes clarity, consistency, and player mastery.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    • Implemented physics collision tuning for stable stacking  
    • Designed score tracking and progression system  
    • Built difficulty increment logic based on successful stacks  
    • Optimized performance for mobile devices  
    • Structured modular code for mechanic expansion  
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
  <p>
    Maintaining consistent stacking behavior required fine-tuning physics parameters.
    Early versions resulted in unpredictable block behavior.
    Adjusting gravity scaling and collision properties ensured reliable stacking mechanics.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    This project improved my understanding of physics tuning, mobile optimization, and short-loop engagement design.
    It reinforced the importance of predictability in skill-based arcade mechanics.
